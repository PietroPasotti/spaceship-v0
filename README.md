============

Basic buggy semi-working totally unplayable version of a tentative concept of a very indie shell-based pseudo-graphical game.

To play, so far, that's what you have to do. Open an IDLE python3 shell and import collector. Then run collector.factionmethods.printOptions() and see what happens. The initial situation involves a randomly generated map, some fleets, two factions and a few ships going around, plus a couple of test buildings.

Move, attack and battling should be already working.
